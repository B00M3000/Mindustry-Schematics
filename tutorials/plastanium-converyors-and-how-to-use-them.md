# How plastanium conveyors work.

This is a guide on how to use plastanium conveyors to improve the efficiency of your base. Plastanium conveyors are very useful to have around, but only if you know how to use them. If you were to place one plastanium conveyor by itself it would be useless. But if you were to place a straight line of them you would see that one end would have a dot on it and the other end would have an X on it.

The dot is the input, and will accept inputs from all sides and add them to a bundle of 10 resources which it then sends down the line. The thing with these bundles are that they can only hold one type of resource, so if you are sending mixed resources down a line it will glitch up and only one will go through.

To solve this problem it is good to do something like this:

## Some tricks for plastanium conveyors.

A plastanium conveyor will occasionally pause loading when it is moving a loaded bundle, so it is sometimes useful to put an overflow gate when you are dealing with a full line.

To unload items directly from a plastanium conveyor without breaking the line you can use unloaders, they will be able to unload two items from each bundle passing by.
